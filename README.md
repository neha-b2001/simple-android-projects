# simple-android-projects
A collection of the simple projects I build as I learn Android Development. These projects are aimed at strengthening fundamental concepts of Android Development. All code is in Java.
1. #### HappyBirthdayCard: 
   My first Android app. A very basic Birthday Card app which helped me to get acquainted with layouts in XML.
2. #### CourtCounter:
   A simple Android app that updates the scores of Team A and Team B depending on whether the '+3', '+2' or 'FREE THROW!' button is selected. Helped me get acquainted with buttons and the onClick XML attribute. Acted as a gateway into Event-Driven Programming.
